# To run a Django project in PyCharm, you first need to open your project and ensure that your virtual environment is activated with all necessary dependencies installed, including Django. Once everything is set up, open the terminal within PyCharm and type the `python manage.py run server` command. This command starts the Django development server, which provides a link, typically `http://127.0.0.1:8000/`, allowing you to access your application on the local host. If you wish to use a custom port, specify it by appending the port number to the command, such as `python manage.py run server 8080`.
